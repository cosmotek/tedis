## I love this. How do I help?

* Simply star this repository :-)
* Help us spread the word on Facebook and Twitter
* Contribute Code! We're developers!
* Medis is available on the Mac App Store as a paid software. I'll be very grateful if you'd like to buy it to encourage me to continue maintaining Medis. There are no additional features comparing with the open-sourced version, except the fact that you can enjoy auto updating that brought by the Mac App Store.
